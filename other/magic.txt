Elements:

            Wind
   Lightning      Snow
Fire                 Water
   Magma          Plant
            Earth

Omnimods for each element:
- Damage (>0)
- Defense (any)
- Status Chance (0-100)
- Status Def (any)

Chance to inflict status calculated similarly to evasion:
   min(100, max(0, {attacker status chance} - {defender status def}))

Status Def > 100 -> ({defender status def} - 100)% of {attacker damage} are
   actually healing defender.

Omnimods are manually set so that gaining X in an element leads to:
* X/2 in the elements next to it.
* -X in the opposite element
* -(X/2) in the elements next to its opposite element

Having this done manually allows for exception.

The element chosen for the status that can be triggered is chosen randomly among
the ones the character, with weights depending on the percentage of the damage
caused by that element. For each element, there are two variants: Alpha, which
inflicts a status on the character getting hit, and Beta, which grants one for
the character doing the hitting. Status are taken into consideration only after
the attack that generated them. Characters may have multiple elemental status in
effect.

Characters affected by the status of element, be it antagonistic or not, gain
affinity in that element (i.e. omnimods for that element, and all the associated
{X/2,-X,-(X/2)} stuff).

* Wind:
   Alpha: Reduces max movement points.
   Beta: Increases max movement points.

* Lightning:
   Alpha: Character is disabled for a turn.
   Beta:
      Attacking this character, regardless of range, will result in taking
      lightning damage.

* Fire:
   Alpha:
      Character suffer fire damage over time (don't forget to make it worth it
      despite the affinity gain).
   Beta:
      Character deals more damage.

* Magma:
   Alpha: TBD
   Beta: TBD + Inflict magma damage when attacked by melee.

* Earth:
   Alpha: Lowers the character's defense
   Beta: Increases the character's defense.

* Plant:
   Alpha: Character cannot be healed, nor gain SPs (not even with skill).
   Beta: Character gains life-steal.

* Water:
   Alpha: Halves the character's HP.
   Beta: The character receives some healing.

* Snow:
   Alpha: Character loses all evasion.
   Beta: Character gets max evasion.
