Characters have an SP gauge. It starts empty.
To be decided: is the capacity of the gauge linked to a (new) stat, or is it
   simply a way to measure how much SP is required before the skill can be cast
   (i.e. it has exactly enough for one cast).

SPs are gained from participation in an attack. The attacker gets 1 point per
attack (which should make being able to do two attacks per turn worthwhile),
1 point for a parry, and, possibly (to be decided), 1 point when defending
(maybe % chance? This reduces the importance of double hits).

Each character has exactly one skill, which is chosen like any other part of
their equipment. Skills have infinite range, and are casted on a single target
(faction is not taken into account), which is either a character or a tile
(that may actually place the skill on a pattern around itself).
The use of a skill counts as an action (i.e. it replaces either switching
weapons or attacking).

Multiple variants of the same skill allow players to select a more costly skill
for an increase in either power (Alpha variant), duration (Beta variant), or
both (Gamma variant). The increase should not be linear (e.g. 2 times the power
costs 175% of the default version). The X Gamma variant combines the advantages
of the Beta and the Alpha versions. It obviously costs way more than either of
them. Another variation could be to have the skill triggered later, by
targeting a tile. Depending on the variant, a character (ally, enemy, or
either) would trigger the effect upon walking on the tile. This could for
example be used for a self-resurrection skill.

Ideas for some skills:
* Attack Anywhere:
   The caster performs an attack on the target with their current weapon,
   regardless of where that target is.

* Shields Up {D, A0, A1, B0, B1, G0, G1}:
   Target benefits from {D: 25, A0: 50, A1: 75}% damage reduction for
   {D: 1, B0: 2, B1: 3} turns.

* Static Heal {D, A0, A1, A2, A3}:
   Target heals for {D: 20, A0: 40, A1: 60, A2: 80, A3: 100} HPs, if nothing
   prevents it.

* Percentage Heal {D, A0, A1, A2, A3}:
   Target heals for {D: 15, A0: 25, A1: 35, A2: 50, A3: 65} percent of their
   maximum HPs, if nothing prevents it.

* Healing Over Time {D, A0, A1, A2, A3, B0, B1, B2, B3, G0, G1, G2, G3}:
   Target gains a {D: 4, B0: 6, B2: 8, B3: 10} turns duration status that heals
   them for {D: 6, A0: 12, A1: 18, A2: 24, A3: 30} HPs.

* Dispel {D, A0}:
   Target loses {D: a random, A0: all} active status(es).

* Redirection:
   Target and caster swaps all their active status.

* Overload {D, A0, A1, B0, B1, G0, G1}:
   Target gains a {D: 1, B0: 2, B1: 3} status providing a {D: 5, A0: 10, A1:
   20}% damage increase per active status (including this one) when attacking.
   The count is done during the attack, not during the cast.

* Trickster {D, A0, A1}:
   Target and caster swaps {D: secondary, A0: active, A1: all} weapon(s).

* Confusion:
   The target equips their secondary weapon.

* Vampire {D, A0, A1, A2, B0, B1, B2, G0, G1, G2}:
   Caster gains the "Vampire" active status. The Vampire status lasts
   {D: 3, B0: 6, B1: 9, B2: 12} turns and, for melee attacks: grants
   {D: 10, A0: 15, A1: 20, A2: 25}% life-steal, and adds the Vampire status
   to the defender (with a reset duration).

* Teleportation:
   The caster is teleported to the target tile, if applicable.

* Switch:
   Caster and target swap locations.

* Mark Target {D, A0, A1, A2, B0, B1, B2, G0, G1, G2}:
   The target gains an active status, "Target", that increases the critical
   chance and precision of attacks it receives. The status lasts {D: 1, B0: 2,
   B1: 3, B2: 4} turns, and increases chances by {D: 15, A0: 25, A1: 35, A2: 45}
   points.

* Petrify {D, B0, B1}:
   The target becomes inactive and invulnerable for {D: 1, B0: 2, B1: 3} turns.

* Sacrifice {D, A0, A1, A2, A3}:
   Target gains <cost of the skill> SP points.

* Denial {D, B0, B1, B2}:
   Target is unable to gain SP points from attacks, parries, or defenses for
   {D: 2, B0: 4, B1: 6} turns.
